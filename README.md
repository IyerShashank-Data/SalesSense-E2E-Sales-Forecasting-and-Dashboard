## ðŸ§  Python Work (Forecasting with Prophet)

I used **Facebook Prophet**, a robust time series forecasting library, to generate reliable sales predictions.

### ðŸ”§ Steps Performed in Python:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted datetime columns
   - Aggregated daily/weekly sales totals
   - Renamed columns to match Prophetâ€™s format (`ds`, `y`)
   - Handled missing values

2. **Model Training**
   - Used Prophetâ€™s default configuration with trend and seasonality
   - Tuned parameters for better fit
   - Generated 3 month future dataframe

3. **Forecast Generation**
   - Output includes:
     - `yhat` (forecasted value)
     - `yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper` (confidence interval)
   - Exported the final DataFrame to CSV for Tableau use

4. **Accuracy Evaluation**
   - Calculated metrics:
     - **MAPE**: 14.13%  
     - **RMSE**: 6762.71
   - Plotted actual vs predicted to validate performance

  ## ðŸ“Œ Strategic Insights

- ðŸ“ˆ **Q2 2019 Sales Spike Expected**  
  The forecast suggests a strong upward trend in Q2 2019. This is a key opportunity to plan ahead â€” increase inventory, ramp up marketing, and prepare operations for high demand.

- ðŸ“‰ **2018 Performance Dip Needs Review**  
  A noticeable drop in 2018 sales indicates a potential issue. This may relate to pricing changes, customer churn, or market shifts. Deeper analysis is recommended.

- ðŸ“Š **Q3 is a Seasonal High Point**  
  Historically, Q3 shows consistent sales strength. This can guide seasonal campaign planning and budget allocations.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Forecast Accuracy is Business-Ready**  
  With a MAPE of ~14%, the model is reliable enough to support real-world planning decisions â€” especially short-term strategy.

> These insights turn raw forecasts into business value, helping teams plan smarter and act faster.


> The final dataset was loaded into Tableau to visualize actuals, forecasts, and confidence intervals interactively.
